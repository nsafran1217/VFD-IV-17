# VFD-IV-17
Schematics, board, and code for IV-17
Arduino library to control IV-17 tubes on my custom board design.

I will come back to this and clean-up once I have an application for the boards.

#vfddesigner
In this folder is a quick and dirty c# application to help create the bytes to send for each digit. The exe is in vfddesigner/bin/Debug.
