# VFD-IV-17
This repository contains an Arduino Library and board design for a 4-tube IV-17 board. These boards are chainable.

Requires a 5V, 2.4V, and 25V power supply.

This board has found a permanent home in my Nixie Weather Clock: https://nsafran.com/nixie-and-vfd-weather-clock.html

Some more info on the use of the boards is on my website: https://nsafran.com/iv17-vfd-board.html

The vfddesigner folder is a quick and dirty c# application to help create the bytes to send for each digit. The exe is in vfddesigner/bin/Debug.
